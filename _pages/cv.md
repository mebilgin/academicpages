At the intersection of human cognition and artificial systems, I research the foundations of intelligence, reasoning, and decision-making mechanisms.

Biography
------
I am currently pursuing my research as an independent researcher in the Cognitive Science program at Yeditepe University.
Prior to that, I worked in industry for 14 years on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; I led teams in Engineering Management and Director of AI Engineering positions and built artificial intelligence systems. In the fast-paced world of industry, my passion for getting to the root of the problem rather than just producing practical solutions led me to academia and independent research.

My Research
------
During my years in industry, I optimized algorithms to produce “better” results. Today, my primary goal is to discover “new questions.” I believe new questions open the door to new knowledge and discoveries in new areas of uncertainty. The fundamental questions I focus on are:

- What is intelligence and how is it measured?
- How does intelligence fundamentally work, and how do humans make decisions under uncertainty?
- How do humans reason?
- How much do uncertainty and bias affect our reasoning?
- When faced with a problem, which planning, reasoning, and decision-making processes does human intelligence use more actively?

In seeking answers to these questions, I conduct my research at the intersection of Computational Cognitive Science, Reasoning, Bayesian Methods, NLP, and Generative AI.
My ultimate goal is to understand the computational mechanisms underlying human cognition and to enable machines to acquire these abilities. This website is my digital laboratory where I share the articles I publish, my research, and the notes I take while exploring new questions.

My work primarily lies at the intersection of the following fields:
- Computational Cognitive Science
- Reasoning & Intelligence
- Decision-Making & Bayesian Methods
- NLP & Generative AI
